afroproto 2.0

For the web application to work you will need to edit some of the files
:-
/src/dbconnection/connectionprovider. change password to the one you use on phpmyadmin.
/webcontent/(check all files to where you see theblackpearl and replace with your current phpmyadmin password)



to access the application you will need to create a server on eclipse and link it to tomcat api. (i use version 7.0)

import hotelprototype2.sql and wetuprototype.sql to phpmyadmin.
